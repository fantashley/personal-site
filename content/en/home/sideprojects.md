I have a passion for decentralized social media and chat services, and I enjoy
  spending my time setting up servers that participate in larger decentralized
  networks. I currently run a [Diaspora server](https://diaspora.pizza) as well
  as a [Matrix server](https://fantashley.com).

I started a DevOps blog called [Just DevOps
  Things](https://justdevopsthings.com/)

I have contributed code and configuration needed to run the microservice
  version of [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite), a Go
  implementation of Matrix Synapse

I contributed a feature to [Ansible AWX](https://github.com/ansible/awx)
  supporting custom python virtual environments when running Ansible playbooks
  in a containerized AWX instance

I enjoy customizing the [firmware](https://github.com/fantashley/qmk_firmware)
  on my mechanical keyboards

My first personal Go project was a multiplayer [Scrabble
  server](https://github.com/fantashley/wordgame-controller). It kind of hurts
  to look at the code now :)
