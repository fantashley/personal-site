I currently work remotely as a Senior Software Engineer at
[Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/), and I've previously worked as a Site
Reliability Engineer at MariaDB Corporation and General Mills. I graduated from
Iowa State in 2013 with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. Though I'm very
interested in cloud, infrastructure, and automation, my current ambition is to
refine my software development skills. My favorite language to code in right now
is Go, and I tend to favor backend development in general.
